# OPG Digital Pre-Commit Hooks

Centralised repository for OPG bespoke pre commit hooks.

We make extensive use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks in OPG to prevent bad coding habits (by linting code before you commit) or things that might cause issues if we commit them (like secrets).

This repo stores our locally created pre-commits, created to solve problems we had in the team. We hope you find them useful.
